spaCy is a library for **advanced Natural Language Processing** in Python and
Cython. It's built on the very latest research, and was designed from day one to
be used in real products.

spaCy comes with
[pretrained pipelines](https://spacy.io/models) and
currently supports tokenization and training for **60+ languages**. It features
state-of-the-art speed and **neural network models** for tagging,
parsing, **named entity recognition**, **text classification** and more,
multi-task learning with pretrained **transformers** like BERT, as well as a
production-ready [**training system**](https://spacy.io/usage/training) and easy
model packaging, deployment and workflow management. spaCy is commercial
open-source software, released under the MIT license.

💫 **Version 3.0 out now!**
